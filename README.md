# RockSense - AI-Powered Rockfall Prediction System

![RockSense Banner](https://placehold.co/1200x630/645546/FFFFFF/png?text=RockSense)

**RockSense** is a web-based platform that leverages generative AI to analyze geotechnical data, predict rockfall hazards in open-pit mines, and provide real-time alerts to enhance site safety.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Risk Prediction**: Utilizes Google's Gemini model to analyze slope geometry, material, environmental factors, and sensor data to predict and delineate high-risk zones.
- **Interactive Risk Map**: A dynamic Google Maps interface to visualize geotechnical data, mark unstable areas, and overlay AI-generated risk polygons.
- **Visual Rock Face Inspection**: Upload an image of a rock face and use an AI vision model to detect cracks, assess stability, and identify potential hazards.
- **Data-Driven Analysis**: Supports uploading custom datasets (CSV) or using sample data to fuel the prediction models.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: View analysis summaries, risk probabilities, and actionable safety recommendations generated by the AI.
- **Export Functionality**: Download the complete risk analysis report as a CSV file for record-keeping and further analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later recommended)
- `pnpm`, `npm`, or `yarn` as your package manager.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your Google Maps API key:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or Firebase App Hosting. Simply connect your GitHub repository to your Vercel account, and it will automatically build and deploy the application upon every push to the `main` branch.
