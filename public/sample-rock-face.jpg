The user wants to add a "Load Sample" feature for the "Visual Inspection" section, using a predefined sample image.

I will add a new "Load Sample" button to the "Visual Inspection" card. When clicked, it will load a predefined sample image of a rockfall and get it ready for analysis.

Here is my plan:

1.  **Add the Sample Image:** I'll save the image you provided to `public/sample-rock-face.jpg`. This makes it available as a static asset within the application.
2.  **Update `src/components/RescueSidebar.tsx`**: I'll add a new "Load Sample" button next to the "Select Image" button inside the "Visual Inspection" accordion.
3.  **Update `src/components/ClientDashboard.tsx`**: I will create a new function, `handleLoadSampleImage`, that fetches the local sample image, converts it to a `File` object, and sets it in the state, making it ready for inspection just as if the user had uploaded it themselves.

This will make the visual inspection feature much more accessible and easier to demonstrate.
